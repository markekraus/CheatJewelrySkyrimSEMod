## About Cheat Jewelry

This mod adds several amulets, circlets, and rings that work as shortcuts to common console command cheats.

## Jewelry

Each of the following has their own amulet, circlet, and ring.

* Cheat: Toggle AI Detection - Toggles NPCs' ability to detect the player.
* Cheat: Toggle Collision - Toggles collision for the player. This allows the player to walk through walls, doors, floors, etc.
* Cheat: Toggle Free Camera - Toggles Free Camera mode. This freezes NPCs and the environment allowing the player camera to move freely to take screenshots or look around.
* Cheat: Toggle God Mode - Toggles God Mode on or off.

## Installation

### Requirements

[ConsoleUtilSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24858) must be installed before installing this mod.

### NMM/Vortex

Download and install with Vortex and the FOMOD installer will take care of the rest.

### Manual

* Extract the 7z file using 7-Zip.
* Copy the extracted `MarkekrausCheatRings.esl` file to the `data` folder under your Skyrim: Special Edition installation folder.
* Copy the extracted `scripts` folder to the `data` folder under your Skyrim: Special Edition installation folder.

## User Guide

The cheat jewelry will be automatically added to your inventory. Items > Armor. Equip the desired amulets, circlets, and/or rings and the cheat(s) will be applied.

Wearing 2 of the same effect (e.g. wearing both the God Mode amulet and ring) will result in strange behavior. Each slot should be a unique cheat.

If you accidentally sell, drop, or otherwise lose the jewelry, you can re-add them to your inventory using console commands.

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with everything and should not require any patches.

## Warning: Not Lore-Friendly and Cheating

This mod is definitely not lore-friendly.

This mod is made for cheating.
